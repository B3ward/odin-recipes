<h2>What is Grilled Cheese Sandwich?</h2>
<p>A grilled cheese sandwich is made by placing a cheese filling, often cheddar or American cheese, between two slices of bread, which is then heated until the bread browns and the cheese melts. A layer of butter or mayonnaise may be added to the outside of the bread for additional flavor and texture.</p>

<h2>Ingredients:</h2>

<ul>
<li>4 slices white bread</li>
<li>3 tablespoons butter, divided</li>
<li>2 slices Cheddar cheese</li>
</ul>


<h2>Steps:</h2>

<ol>
<li>Preheat a nonstick skillet over medium heat. Generously butter one side of a slice of bread. Place bread butter-side down in the hot skillet; add 1 slice of cheese. Butter a second slice of bread on one side and place butter-side up on top of cheese.</li>
<li>Cook until lightly browned on one side; flip over and continue cooking until cheese is melted. Repeat with remaining 2 slices of bread, butter, and slice of cheese.</li>
</ol>
